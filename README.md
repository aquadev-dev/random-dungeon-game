<h1>Monk Random Dungeon Game</h1>
<p>An assignment where I developed a random dungeon game where you play as a monk.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  This is my portfolio piece, which I submitted as part of my assignment for Object-Oriented Systems Development. The game allows users to play as a monk trying to reach the treasure room in a randomly generated dungeon. This program was written in its entirety in C++ with the implementation of design  patterns such as factory method, observer, singleton, and state.
