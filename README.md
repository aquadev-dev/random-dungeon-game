<p>An assignment where I developed a random dungeon game where you play as a monk.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  This is my portfolio piece that I submitted as part of my assignment for Object Orientated Systems Development where users can play as a monk trying to reach the treasure room in a randomly generated dungeon. This program was written in its entirity in C++ with the implementation of design  patterns such as factory method, observer, singleton, state.
